## Category 1: Foundational Concepts & Techniques

These are fundamental building blocks and algorithmic approaches that apply across many problems.

### 1. Arrays

- **What it is:** A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations, accessed by index.
- **Importance:** The most basic data structure. Many other data structures (like heaps) are often array-based. Understanding array manipulation (resizing, sorting, searching) is crucial.
- **C++:** C-style arrays (`int arr[size];`), `std::array` (fixed-size, compile-time size), `std::vector` (dynamic array â€“ **YOUR GO-TO FOR MOST ARRAY-LIKE PROBLEMS**).
- **Java:** `int[] arr = new int[size];`, `ArrayList` (dynamic array).
- **Python:** `list` (dynamic array, highly flexible).

### 2. Strings

- **What it is:** A sequence of characters. Often implemented internally as an array of characters.
- **Importance:** Frequent interview topic involving character manipulation, pattern matching, palindromes, anagrams.
- **C++:** `char[]` (C-style string), `std::string`.
- **Java:** `String` (immutable), `StringBuilder` (mutable).
- **Python:** `str` (immutable).

### 3. Recursion

- **What it is:** A function that calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems.
- **Importance:** Absolutely crucial for understanding tree traversals, graph algorithms (DFS), dynamic programming, backtracking, and divide-and-conquer. Essential to master the base case and recursive step.

### 4. Bit Manipulation

- **What it is:** Performing operations directly on the binary representations of numbers (using bitwise operators like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts).
- **Importance:** Can be used to optimize solutions (space/time) for certain problems, especially those involving sets, flags, or counting. Common in competitive programming and some niche interview problems.

## Category 2: Linear Data Structures

Data elements are arranged sequentially.

### 5. Linked List

- **What it is:** A sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
- **Types:** Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.
- **Importance:** Tests your understanding of pointers/references, memory management (especially in C++), and iterative/recursive traversal.
- **C++:** You'll often implement this from scratch for learning; `std::list` (doubly linked) and `std::forward_list` (singly linked) exist.
- **Java:** `LinkedList` (doubly linked).
- **Python:** No direct built-in; usually implemented from scratch or simulated with `list`.

### 6. Stacks

- **What it is:** A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure. Think of a stack of plates.
- **Importance:** Used for function call management (recursion), expression evaluation, balancing parentheses, backtracking, and depth-first search (DFS).
- **C++:** `std::stack` (an adapter, can use `std::vector` or `std::deque` as underlying container).
- **Java:** `Stack` (legacy, `ArrayDeque` is preferred), `ArrayDeque`.
- **Python:** `list` (using `append()` and `pop()`), `collections.deque`.

### 7. Queues

- **What it is:** A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure. Think of a line at a store.
- **Importance:** Used for managing tasks, breadth-first search (BFS), and scheduling.
- **C++:** `std::queue` (an adapter, can use `std::deque` or `std::list` as underlying container).
- **Java:** `Queue` (interface, implemented by `LinkedList` or `ArrayDeque`).
- **Python:** `collections.deque`, `queue.Queue` (for multithreading).

## Category 3: Non-Linear Data Structures

Data elements are not arranged sequentially; they have hierarchical or networked relationships.

### 8. Binary Trees

- **What it is:** A hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right).
- **Importance:** Foundation for many other data structures (BSTs, Heaps, Tries) and graph algorithms.
- **Concepts:** Root, node, child, parent, leaf, height, depth, various traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order - BFS).
- **C++/Java/Python:** Usually implemented from scratch (defining a `Node` class/struct).

### 9. Binary Search Trees (BST)

- **What it is:** A special type of binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to any value in its left subtree and less than or equal to any value in its right subtree.
- **Importance:** Allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion ($O(\log N)$ on average). Demonstrates understanding of tree properties.
- **C++/Java/Python:** Usually implemented from scratch for learning. `std::map`/`std::set` in C++ and `TreeMap`/`TreeSet` in Java are typically implemented using self-balancing BSTs (like Red-Black Trees) internally.

### 10. Heaps

- **What it is:** A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property (min-heap: parent $\le$ children; max-heap: parent $\ge$ children). Often implemented using an array.
- **Importance:** Efficiently finds the minimum/maximum element, used in `PriorityQueue` implementations, heap sort, and for problems requiring continuous access to min/max.
- **C++:** `std::priority_queue` (max-heap by default).
- **Java:** `PriorityQueue` (min-heap by default).
- **Python:** `heapq` module (provides min-heap functions for lists).
- **Key Operations:** `insert`, `extract_min/max`, `peek_min/max`, `heapify`.

### 11. Hashing (Hash Tables/Maps)

- **What it is:** A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Provides average $O(1)$ time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup.
- **Importance:** Crucial for efficient lookups, frequency counting, caching, and solving problems involving unique elements or key-value pairs.
- **Concepts:** Hash function, collision resolution (chaining, open addressing).
- **C++:** `std::unordered_map` (key-value), `std::unordered_set` (keys only).
- **Java:** `HashMap`, `HashSet`.
- **Python:** `dict`, `set`.

### 12. Tries (Prefix Trees)

- **What it is:** A tree-like data structure used to store a collection of strings where each node represents a character. Useful for efficient retrieval of keys based on prefixes.
- **Importance:** Commonly used for autocomplete features, spell checkers, and efficient prefix-based searching.
- **C++/Java/Python:** Usually implemented from scratch.

### 13. Graphs

- **What it is:** A set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Represents relationships between objects.

## Category 4: Algorithmic Paradigms

These are general problem-solving approaches that define how you structure an algorithm.

### 14. Divide and Conquer

- **What it is:** Break a problem into smaller, independent subproblems of the same type, solve them recursively, and combine their results.
- **Examples:** Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, Karatsuba Multiplication.

### 15. Greedy Algorithms

- **What it is:** Make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope that this will lead to a globally optimal solution.
- **Important Note:** Doesn't always work! You often need to prove its correctness.
- **Examples:** Coin change (some variations), Activity Selection, Huffman Coding, Dijkstra's (if edges are non-negative), Prim's, Kruskal's.

### 16. Backtracking

- **What it is:** A general algorithmic technique for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems. It incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracking") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be extended to a valid complete solution. Often used for search problems.
- **Relation to Recursion:** Inherently recursive.
- **Examples:** N-Queens problem, Sudoku Solver, Permutations/Combinations, Subsets, Maze Solving.

### 17. Dynamic Programming (DP)

- **What it is:** An optimization technique that solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid recomputing them.
